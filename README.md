**NOTE: Materials are in the process of being updated for Summer 2018.**

# Intro to Python Workshop Materials

The materials here are split into 4 parts, usually covered in separate sessions during in-person workshops.  Each part has lecture notes that the instructor will work from as well as exercise files, both with and without answers (you'll learn more if you don't cheat!).  

The lecture notes are meant for reference.  The instructor may deviate from them during the workshop, and will cover topics that may not be included there.

## Downloading Files

### Recommended: Entire directory

You can download all of the files by clicking the green button above and choosing "Download ZIP."

### Individual Files

**If you download files from the links above, you have to click through to the RAW version of the notebook and download that.  If you download directly from the links above, the files won't open because they are web pages, not the raw files.**

## Exercises

See the individual directories.
