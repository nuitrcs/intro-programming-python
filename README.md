# Intro to Python Workshop Materials

The materials here are split into 4 parts, usually covered in separate sessions during in-person workshops.  Each part has lecture notes that the instructor will work from as well as exercise files, both with and without answers (you'll learn more if you don't cheat!).  

The lecture notes are meant for reference.  The instructor may deviate from them during the workshop, and will cover topics that may not be included there.

Part 1 uses Jupyter notebooks (previously called iPython notebooks).  The easiest way to install this is to use the Anaconda distribution of Python.  To get it running, see [Jupyter Notebook Beginner Guide](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
